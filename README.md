## About the project 

ML multiclass classification project for forest cover data set

This project is nothing but a set systematic analyses done on the UCI data set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype). 

This is a joint project done by me and Akhil (https://github.com/akhilnandyala)

We basically  applied various types of Machine Learning algorithms on the data set and systematically evaluated which once approach is the best for this multi-class classification problem. You can check the PDF presenattion ( not top notch-ly :P converted from ppt tp PDF) to get to know more on what we actually did in the project.

## Installation / setup / getting started

You can pretty much run this project in google collaboratory or any python notebook (.pynb). Just install the dependancies as and when you see that it is needed. I have not documented that list.
